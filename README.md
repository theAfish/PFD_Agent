# MatCreator

MatCreator is a **skill-based, agentic platform** for computational material science tasks, with a focus on Machine Learning Force Field (MLFF) generation and application. It would evolve with users by experience accumulation and creation of new skills. 

## Quick start
### Installation
```bash
# Create and activate an environment with uv (optional but recommended)

pip install uv
uv venv .venv --python 3.12

source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

After installation, tell the CLI where the project root lives:

```bash
# Run from the repo directory
matcreator init .

# Or specify an absolute path
matcreator init /path/to/PFD-Agent
```

This writes `~/.matcreator/config.yaml` with the `project_root` path, so the
CLI can locate the `agents/` directory even when installed into site-packages.
You can also set the `MATCREATOR` environment variable instead.

## Vite Frontend Requirements

This project includes a frontend interface. The frontend depends on `node`, `npm`, and the local `vite` dev server.

### Install NVM

Use NVM to manage Node.js.

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify installation:
nvm --version
```

### Install Node.js
```bash
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
nvm alias default 22
```

Verify the installation
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd web/vite-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Recommended Workflow: WSL + uv for Virtual Environment Deployment

We highly recommend using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with uv to deploy local development virtual environments. WSL provides a native Linux environment seamlessly integrated with Windows, enabling access to Linux tools. As a fast, lightweight Python package manager, uv creates isolated environments to avoid dependency conflicts, ideal for Python applications like Streamlit.

#### Why Use pipx for uv in WSL

In WSL, system Python is managed by apt and is a core system component. PEP 668 prohibits direct pip installation to avoid breaking system dependencies. Pipx is ideal for tools like uv: it creates isolated virtual environments for global access without polluting system Python.

#### Solution: Install uv Using pipx

As a command-line tool, uv can be installed via pipx, which creates an independent virtual environment for global use. Run these commands in the WSL terminal:

```bash
# 1. Install pipx
sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx -y

# 2. Initialize pipx (add to system PATH)
pipx ensurepath

# 3. Restart terminal, then install uv
pipx install uv
```

### Running agent networks
#### Setting environments
Before the first run, create the `agents/MatCreator/.env` file and configure your model API credentials (additional environment variables may be required for some functionalities).

```bash
touch agents/MatCreator/.env
```

An example content of `.env`:

```env
LLM_MODEL= "MODEL_TYPE"
GRAPH_AGENT_MODEL="MODEL_TYPE"             # optional; defaults to LLM_MODEL
REVIEW_AGENT_MODEL="MODEL_TYPE"            # optional; defaults to GRAPH_AGENT_MODEL
LLM_API_KEY="API_KEYS"
LLM_BASE_URL="BASE_URL"
EMBEDDING_MODEL="EMBEDDING_MODEL_TYPE"
MATCREATOR_AUTO_REVIEW=1
MATCREATOR_REVIEW_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD=20
MATCREATOR_REVIEW_BATCH_SIZE=5
MATCREATOR_REVIEW_STRATEGY=auto             # auto, seed, or global

# SKILL_RELATED_ENV
CGCNN_ROOT=user/cgcnn                         # CGCNN project directory
MATTERGEN_ENV=user/../.mattergen              # MATTERGEN virtual environment
TAVILY_API_KEY=""
BOHRIUM_MAT_IMAGE=""                          # MATTERGEN and MATTERSIM IMAGE
BOHRIUM_MAT_MACHINE=""                        # MATTERGEN and MATTERSIM IMAGE
eval_reference="user/../reference_MP2020correction.gz"
mattersim_model="user/../mattersim-v1.0.0-5M.pth"
mattergen_model="user/../mattergen/checkpoints"
BOHRIUM_VASP_IMAGE=""
BOHRIUM_VASP_MACHINE=""
...
```

`KDG_DB_PATH` is optional. If you leave it unset, MatCreator stores the
knowledge graph at `~/.matcreator/.adk/know_do_graph.db` by default.

If you prefer different LLM models for sub-agents, you can override the default setting at the `.env` file within sub-agents directories. 

#### Web UI (Recommended)
A modern web UI with graph visualization, artifact upload/download, structure visualization, and scientific plotting. Start all three services (ADK API server, FastAPI middle layer, and Vite frontend) with a single script:

```bash
bash script/start_matcreator.sh
```

This starts:
- **ADK API server** on `http://localhost:8000`
- **FastAPI middle layer** on `http://localhost:8001`
- **Vite frontend** on `http://localhost:5173`

Logs are written to `~/.matcreator/logs/{api-server,web-main,vite}.log` by default. Set `MATCREATOR_LOG_DIR=/path/to/logs` to override this location. The API server starts with `MATCREATOR_API_LOG_LEVEL=debug` so ADK/LLM request logs are captured; set it to `info` for quieter logs. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all services.

> No frontend build step is needed — the Vite dev server runs directly with hot-reload.

#### Server mode: multi-user Docker deployment

Server mode is intended for a shared group server. It runs a control plane behind
nginx and starts one isolated Docker worker per registered user. Each worker sees
its own `/root/.matcreator` directory, backed by persistent host data under
`server-data/users/<user_id>/.matcreator`. Local/single-user mode is unchanged:
it does not require auth or Docker and continues to use `~/.matcreator`.

```bash
# Build the MatCreator image
docker compose build

# Choose where user data should persist on the host
export MATCREATOR_HOST_DATA_ROOT="$(pwd)/server-data"

# Start nginx + control plane; workers are created lazily on login/register
docker compose -f docker-compose.server.yml up -d
```

Open `http://localhost`, register a user, and log in. Logging out stops that
user's worker container; idle workers are also stopped after
`MATCREATOR_WORKER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` seconds. See
[`deploy/server-mode.md`](deploy/server-mode.md) for the full setup guide,
resource-control options, data layout, and troubleshooting commands.

#### Non-interactive CLI mode

Run the agent on a single prompt without starting any server:

```bash
# Inline prompt
matcreator run -p "Build a silicon FCC structure"

# Prompt from a file
matcreator run -f prompt.txt

# Save the answer to a file
matcreator run -p "Build a silicon FCC structure" -o result.txt

# Full structured JSON output (includes turn count, duration, etc.)
matcreator run -p "Build a silicon FCC structure" --output-format json -o result.json

# Override the workspace directory
matcreator run --workspace /data/my_workspace -p "Build a silicon FCC structure"
# or via environment variable
MATCLAW_WORKSPACE=/data/my_workspace matcreator run -p "Build a silicon FCC structure"
```

Each run creates a session directory under `<workspace>/sessions/<session-id>/` where any files produced by the agent are saved.

#### Default adk web server (old style)

```bash
matcreator run web
```
This would set up the MatCreator agent network through the default `adk web` server. You can tune the LLM model and communication settings for the agents.

The default agent workspace is located at `agents/MatCreator/.workspace`, where skills, memory, etc., are stored.

## Skills
MatCreator follows a modular design principle: skills are text files that define metadata, procedures and workflows. Some skills may require specialized tools (configured by `$PROJECT/agents/MatCreator/tools.py`), and some of them, e.g. tools for DFT calculations, may be hosted on MCP servers.

> The default domain-based computational materials datasets is located at `database/domain_datasets.tar.gz`, which should be extracted for database skill usage. (See `tools/database/README.md`)

> Check the `README.md` in `skills/$SKILL` if you really wanna use them. 


> **Note — transitioning from MCP servers to skills:** MatCreator is progressively moving tool logic out of dedicated MCP servers and into self-contained skills. A skill bundles its own workflow instructions, helper scripts, and configuration alongside the `.md` file, so it can be run with only a general-purpose shell/Python tool rather than a running server process. If a capability you previously used via an MCP server is no longer listed under `tools/`, check `agents/MatCreator/knowledge/skills/` — it may have been migrated to a skill. MCP servers are retained only for tools that genuinely require a persistent service (e.g. a remote job scheduler or a database backend).


###  Server setup (Optional)
For example, to set up a `mcp` server for `ABACUS` DFT software, `uv run` the script: 

```bash
cd tools/abacus
uv sync 

uv run server.py --port 50001
```
 You may need to set environment variables specific to the mcp server at `tools/$TOOLNAME/.env`, which can be referenced in `tools/$TOOLNAME/README.md`

### Customize skills

Skills are Markdown files with a YAML frontmatter block (declaring `name`, `description`, `tools`, and `dependent_skills`) followed by a plain-text instruction body. The active loader discovers any workspace directory that contains a `SKILL.md` file, including nested directories such as `skills/mattergen/mattergen_generation/SKILL.md`. MatCreator loads skills from two locations in order:

1. **Built-in skills** — shipped with the package under `agents/MatCreator/knowledge/skills/`. Skills can be placed as flat `<name>.md` files or in a subdirectory `<name>/<name>.md`; the subdirectory form takes precedence.
2. **Workspace overlay** — your personal skills under `$MATCLAW_WORKSPACE/skills/` (defaults to `.workspace/` in the project root). Any skill here with the same name overrides the built-in version.

To customize a skill manually, copy its skill directory into your workspace `skills/` directory and edit the contained `SKILL.md`. To add a new skill, create a new `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file following the same frontmatter format.

The agent can also create and update skills on its own. During a session, the thinking agent can call built-in tools to scaffold a new skill file, write updated content to an existing one, or list what skills are currently available — letting the system accumulate knowledge automatically over time.

## Know-Do Graph

MatCreator uses `know-do-graph` for both durable knowledge and working memory:

- **Know-Do Graph** stores curated capabilities, procedures, workflows, and
  distilled heuristics in `~/.matcreator/.adk/know_do_graph.db` by default.
- **MemGraph** stores frequently updated agent observations as
  `EntryType.memory` nodes and normal graph edges in the same SQLite database.

Skills and guides are seeded as durable entries. Agent writes first land in
MemGraph; repeated successful observations are later distilled into validated
Know-Do heuristics and linked to the capabilities they improve. Existing
`skill_graph.db`, `memory_graph.db`, old JSON traces, and `MEMORY.md` data can be migrated
idempotently through `matcreator knowledge migrate`. Normal runtime startup does
not load legacy sources automatically. See [docs/knowledge_graph.md](docs/knowledge_graph.md).

Retrieval is progressive: MatCreator first searches L1 capabilities/workflows
and L2 procedures, then conditionally searches only the selected node's attached
L3 heuristics and L4 constraints. The planning agent can also invoke the
policy-controlled Know-Do reviewer for graph review or session-memory
distillation. Nodes marked `peer_reviewed` or `community_tested` are protected
from mutation during these reviews.

## Graph-Based Planning

When given a goal, the thinking agent produces an **execution graph** — a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node is a discrete action and each edge encodes a dependency.

```
step_download_data ──► step_relax ──► step_postprocess
                   └──► step_static ─►
```

Key properties:

- **Nodes** carry a `node_id`, human-readable `label`, natural-language `action` description, and a list of `suggested_skills`.
- **Edges** are `[predecessor_id, successor_id]` pairs. A node cannot start until all its predecessors have succeeded.
- **Parallel execution**: nodes with no unresolved dependencies are dispatched concurrently in a single turn.
- **Failure propagation**: if a node fails, all transitive dependents are marked `blocked` automatically.

The agent validates the graph for cycles before presenting it to the user, then waits for explicit confirmation before handing it off to the execution agent.

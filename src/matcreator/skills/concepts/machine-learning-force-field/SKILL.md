# Machine Learning Force Field (MLFF)

A Machine Learning Force Field (MLFF) is a surrogate model trained on DFT reference data that predicts atomic energies and forces at a fraction of the computational cost. MLFFs enable large-scale and long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations that would be prohibitively expensive with DFT directly.

## Workflow Phases

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pre-trained model** | A general-purpose model trained on large, diverse datasets. Try this first. |
| **Fine-tuning** | Adapts a pre-trained model to a target system using domain-specific DFT data. |
| **Training from scratch** | Used in distillation: train a lightweight student model on teacher-labeled data. |
| **Inference / MD** | Deploy the trained model for structure relaxation or molecular dynamics. |

## When to Use

- Run MD exploration to sample the configuration space of a new material.
- Relax generated structures before DFT validation.
- Screen large candidate sets efficiently before expensive DFT runs.
- Replace DFT in high-throughput workflows after validating accuracy.

## Available Tool Skills

| Skill | Framework | Best For |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `deepmd` | DeePMD-kit | Training and fine-tuning DPA-1/DPA-2 models; PFD workflow |
| `dpa4` | DeePMD-kit (DPA-4) | Fine-tuning DPA-4 (SeZM/dpa4) models on Bohrium; early stage |
| `mattersim` | MatterSim | Pre-trained universal MLFF; structure relaxation and MD |
| `ase-deepmd` | ASE + DeePMD | Running MD with a trained DeePMD model via ASE interface |

Load the appropriate tool skill for detailed instructions (e.g., `load_skill("deepmd")`).

## Choosing a Framework

- Use `deepmd` when you need to **train or fine-tune** a DPA-1/DPA-2 model on your own DFT dataset.
- Use `dpa4` when you need to **fine-tune a DPA-4 (SeZM/dpa4) model** — runs exclusively on Bohrium; currently in early stage.
- Use `mattersim` when you want a **pre-trained universal model** without retraining.
- Use `ase-deepmd` when you need to run **MD simulations** with a trained DeePMD potential.
